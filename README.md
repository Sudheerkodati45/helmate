# IoT based Smart Helmet for Industrial Workers
Safety is very important in every workplace, but very often we hear about accidents in factories industries causing loss of life. The labours and workers working in any factory, industries, construction site or mine is vulnerable to accidents and therefore they should be with safety guards properly. In most of the accidents, number of deaths or severe injuries is maximized because the labours and worker are not wearing safety equipment or wearing low grade safety equipment. Working environment hazards include radiation leakage, fall due to suffocation, poisoning gas leakage and gas explosion. Hence air quality and hazardous event detection is very important factor in industry. In order to achieve those safety measures, the proposed system provides wireless sensors network for monitoring real time situation of working environment from monitoring station.
